This Project was focused on analysing and visualising specific song listings on spotify music platform inoder to visualise the songs with the highest number of likes
First of all I download the file from the list of files available for the class project
Next I imported the file into my notebook and converted it into a dataframe
And then i worked on cleaning the dataset by converting the data types of the date column to datetime and the rest of the columns to integers.
I then converted the column names in my dataset needed to lower cases, repalced the spaces with underscore and removed special characters on the column names
The missing values in the dataset may suggest that the song was not released on the date stated so I went ahead to replace all NaN values with zero (0)
Moving on from the cleaning phase to Exploratory Data Analysis phase, I intended to answer 3 specific questions that would enable me draw insight from this dataset, the questions include; 
What song has the highest average likes overall
what month has the highest likes for the song with overall highest likes
what year has the highest likes on spotify based on given data
I was able to visualise my data and get answers to the above questions. Some of the insights gotten from this dataset includes;
The song despacito has the overall highest number of likes
June 2017 has the highest likes for the song Despacito which has the average overall higest likes
based on the data given the year 2017 records more activity
